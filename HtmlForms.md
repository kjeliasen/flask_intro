<p>Create the form outlined in the lesson above that greets a user when they
   type in their name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying Model Output</p>
<p>Now we will build a web app that lets a user type a message into an input
field and uses our model to look at the user's input and predict whether or
not what they submitted is spam.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a route within your application that shows an HTML form that
   contains an input field for a text message.</li>
<li>Create an endpoint that handles the form submission. Inside of this
   function, your should use the <code>predict</code> function from your <code>model</code> module
   to make a prediction about the user's input.</li>
<li>Display the user's input along with the model's prediction in another
   html page.</li>
</ol>
